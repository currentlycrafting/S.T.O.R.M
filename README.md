# S.T.O.R.M â€“ Scalable, Thread-Safe, Orchestrated, Replicated Memory-store

S.T.O.R.M is a **high-performance, in-memory key-value store** implemented in C++17. It is designed for **high-concurrency workloads**, supporting sharded LRU eviction, thread-safe operations, batch writes, and an interactive CLI interface. Ideal for applications requiring fast, scalable memory storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++17  
- **Testing:** GoogleTest  
- **Build System:** CMake  
- **Containerization:** Docker (Ubuntu 22.04 base)

---

## Features

- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Each shard uses `std::mutex` to minimize lock contention for multi-threaded `PUT`, `GET`, and `DEL` operations.  
- **Sharding:** Keys are distributed across multiple shards to reduce bottlenecks, with independent LRU eviction per shard.  
- **LRU Eviction:** Automatically removes the least recently used entries when a shard reaches capacity.  
- **Batch Operations:** Supports `putMany` for efficient batch writes, reducing lock overhead.  
- **CLI Interface:** Interactive command-line tool with commands: `PUT`, `GET`, `DEL`, `LIST`, `CLEAR`, `HISTORY`, `HELP`, and `EXIT`.  
- **High-Concurrency Testing:** Designed to handle 100+ threads performing millions of operations reliably.

## Example CLI Commands

```bash
> PUT foo bar
{ "success": true }

> GET foo
{ "success": true, "value": "bar" }

> LIST
{ "shard_0": { "foo": "bar" } }

> DEL foo
{ "success": true }

> HISTORY
{ "history": ["PUT foo bar", "GET foo", "LIST", "DEL foo"] }
```
