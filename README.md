# S.T.O.R.M â€“ Scalable, Thread-Safe, Orchestrated, Replicated Memory-store

S.T.O.R.M is a **high-performance, in-memory key-value store** implemented in C++17. It is designed for **high-concurrency workloads**, supporting sharded LRU eviction, thread-safe operations, batch writes, and an interactive CLI interface. Ideal for applications requiring fast, scalable memory storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++17  
- **Testing:** GoogleTest  
- **Build System:** CMake  
- **Containerization:** Docker (Ubuntu 22.04 base)

---

## Features

- **Thread-Safe Operations:** Each shard uses `std::mutex` to minimize lock contention for multi-threaded `PUT`, `GET`, and `DEL` operations.  
- **Sharding:** Keys are distributed across multiple shards to reduce bottlenecks, with independent LRU eviction per shard.  
- **LRU Eviction:** Automatically removes the least recently used entries when a shard reaches capacity.  
- **Batch Operations:** Supports `putMany` for efficient batch writes, reducing lock overhead.  
- **CLI Interface:** Interactive command-line tool with commands: `PUT`, `GET`, `DEL`, `LIST`, `CLEAR`, `HISTORY`, `HELP`, and `EXIT`.  
- **High-Concurrency Testing:** Designed to handle 100+ threads performing millions of operations reliably.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

**Test Configuration:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Number of Shards | 30 |
| Shard Capacity | 4,000 keys |
| Threads | 350 |
| Ops per Thread | 300,000 |
| Total Ops | 105,000,000 |
| Runtime | ~75 seconds |
| Throughput | ~1.39M ops/sec |

**Interpretation:**

- High throughput demonstrates effective **sharding** and **mutex-per-shard** design.  
- LRU eviction works correctly under heavy load.  
- Recency updates are accurate on both `GET` and `PUT`.

## Contributing

- Follow **clean coding practices**: descriptive variable names, consistent indentation, and clear comments.  
- Use `@brief` comment style for new functions.  
- Ensure **thread-safety** in all new operations.  
- Submit pull requests with clear descriptions and maintain compatibility with existing tests.
