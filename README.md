# S.T.O.R.M â€“ Scalable, Thread-Safe, Orchestrated, Replicated Memory-store

S.T.O.R.M is a high-performance, in-memory key-value store implemented in C++17. It supports sharded LRU eviction, thread-safe operations, and batch writes, making it ideal for high-concurrency workloads.

---

### Tech Stack

* **Language**: C++17
* **Testing**: GoogleTest
* **Build**: CMake
* **Containerization**: Docker (Ubuntu 22.04 base)

---

### Features

* **Thread-Safe Operations**: Individual shards are protected by `std::mutex` to minimize lock contention. It supports multi-threaded `PUT`, `GET`, and `DEL` operations.
* **Sharding**: Keys are distributed across multiple shards to reduce bottlenecks. Each shard has independent LRU eviction and capacity control.
* **LRU Eviction**: Automatically removes the least recently used entries when a shard reaches its capacity.
* **Batch Operations**: Supports `putMany` for efficient batch writes, which significantly reduces lock overhead.
* **CLI Interface**: An interactive command-line tool with commands: `PUT`, `GET`, `DEL`, `LIST`, `CLEAR`, `HISTORY`, `HELP`, and `EXIT`.
* **High-Concurrency Stress Testing**: Supports 100+ threads performing millions of operations, ensuring reliability under heavy load.
